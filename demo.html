<h1>Welcome to my HTMLParser!</h1>
<p>
This is an HTMLParser I built in order to refresh my Python skills, because I
am going to use it in a college course about AI. My idea is to actually have
a Markdown parser with math functions to accompany this, so that's why we have
limited supported tags and props. In the end, I will have a markup language for
documents, class notes, etc.

<p>
Please note that my Python is very bad, and I learned everything by doing, 
so I'm probably not following any best practices.
